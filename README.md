# word-to-dita-xml

STEP 01
-------
1. Open a Word document
2. Run the 'Main' sub-procedure in `bookmap.bas` - it will:
   * Write a new boiler-plate BOOKMAP file (as a Word document)
   * Add chapter-elements from the headings in the Word document with the 'dita-chapter' style
   * Then offer to save the BOOKMAP file (using the name of the Word document)

*Note:* If you save the Word document with the `.txt` extension you can change it later to `.ditamap`.
