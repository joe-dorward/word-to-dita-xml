# word-to-dita-xml

STEP 01
-------
1. Open a Word document
2. Run the 'Main' sub-procedure in bookmap.bas - it will:
   * Create a new boiler-plate BOOKMAP file
   * Add chapter-elements from the headings in the Word document with the 'dita-chapter' style
   * Then offer to save the BOOKMAP file (using the name of the Word document) as a `.txt` file (which you can change to `.ditamap` later)
