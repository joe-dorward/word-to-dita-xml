# Converting legacy Word documents to DITA XML
Having developed an interest in converting legacy Word documentation into DITA XML documents using Visual Basic for Applications sub-procedures, I decided to prove-the-concept by taking a +20-year old Word document and converting it into a set of DITA XML documents.

I created the original version of `C Lesson 1.docx` as a handout for a C programming course I was teaching in 2000. I realised that I could save myself a lot of work if I converted the 'handouts' to HTML 'webouts' and hosted them on a website. That first conversion was done the hard way - using Word to save the documents as HTML files and completing the conversion process by hand in Notepad. This conversion will be done the smart way - using VBA!
