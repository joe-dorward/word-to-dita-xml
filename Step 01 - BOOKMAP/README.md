# Step 01
1. Open `C Lesson 1.docx`
2. Run the `Main()` sub-procedure in `bookmap.bas` - it will:
   * Process `C Lesson 1.docx`
   * Open a new Word document 
   * Write BOOKMAP boiler-plate and chapter-elements (corresponding to the headings in `C Lesson 1.docx` with the named 'Heading 1' style)
   * Then offer to save it as `b_c_lesson_1.docx` - if you save the Word document with the `.txt` extension, you can change it later to `.ditamap`
